# Example 3 Developing Backbone Applications

The code is from http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/#exercise-3-your-first-modular-backbone-requirejs-app

This example was modified to use Jade templating instead of Underscore

## How to test

1. run `npm install` to download bower
2. run `./node_modules/bower/bin/bower install` to download JS dependencies
3. run `make deploy` to get a full working example in _deploy_ directory
